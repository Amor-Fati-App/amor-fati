# Progress

## Current Status

Memory Bank initialization is in progress and near completion.

## What Works / Exists

- Comprehensive product requirements document exists in legacy file:
  - `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`
- Newly established Memory Bank core context files:
  - `projectBrief.md`
  - `productContext.md`
  - `systemPatterns.md`
  - `techContext.md`
  - `activeContext.md`
  - `progress.md` (this file)
- Initialization plan documented:
  - `initialize-memory-bank-plan.md`

## Remaining Work (Initialization)

- Add optional continuous-learning files:
  - `raw_reflection_log.md`
  - `consolidated_learnings.md`
- Verify final file set against Memory Bank required structure.
- Commit and push initialization branch milestone.

## Known Issues / Risks

- App-level auth/onboarding logic has potential edge-case gaps (redirect and profile checks).
- Project README remains generic Vite template and does not reflect product specifics.

## Milestone History
