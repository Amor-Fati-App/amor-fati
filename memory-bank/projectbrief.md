# Project Brief: Amor Fati

## Project Summary

Amor Fati is an AI-assisted Tarot journaling application focused on reflection, pattern awareness,
and actionable self-discovery. The product is intentionally positioned away from fortune-telling
and toward collaborative interpretation, user agency, and psychologically safe guidance.

## Current Product State

- Active codebase is a React + Vite web client in `amor-fati/`.
- Current implemented foundations include landing, auth, protected routes, and onboarding UI.
- Product-level vision and requirements are documented in detail in:
  - `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` (legacy comprehensive PRD file, preserved as source context)

## Core Goals

1. Build a trusted daily/weekly reflective ritual.
2. Blend Tarot symbolism with AI co-interpretation and journaling.
3. Help users track recurring emotional/symbolic patterns over time.
4. Translate insights into small concrete actions.

## Primary User Segments

- Reflective seekers
- Tarot enthusiasts
- Burned-out knowledge workers seeking non-deterministic, symbolic reframing

## Success Direction (High-Level)

- Strong retention through ritualized use
- High completion of readings + written reflections
- Perceived value from pattern insights and summaries
- Trust through transparent, non-deterministic AI behavior

## Constraints and Principles

- Reflection-first, not prediction-first.
- Preserve user agency in all interpretation outputs.
- Maintain privacy and secure handling of journal-like personal content.
