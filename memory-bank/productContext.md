# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Amor Fati exists to make Tarot a practical self-reflection ritual rather than a predictive tool.
It aims to help users process emotions, notice recurring life patterns, and turn insights into
small, intentional actions.

## User Problems Being Solved

- Tarot apps often feel deterministic or superficial.
- Generic journaling apps lack symbolic structure.
- Paper journaling is hard to search, analyze, and revisit over time.
- Users need psychologically safe guidance that does not override intuition.

## Product Experience Goals

- Low-friction daily use (single-card reflection in minutes).
- Deeper weekly sessions (multi-card spreads with synthesis).
- Collaborative AI tone: suggestive, non-authoritative, non-deterministic.
- Compounding value over time through history, tags, and pattern insights.

## Principles for UX and Content

- Tarot as mirror, not oracle.
- User agency over AI authority.
- Clarity and warmth over mystical opacity.
- Strong privacy expectations around reflective personal writing.

## Near-Term Product Focus

- Stabilize onboarding-to-authenticated-user flow.
- Build usable core journey: reading -> reflection -> save -> revisit.
- Prepare data model and interface for future pattern insights.
